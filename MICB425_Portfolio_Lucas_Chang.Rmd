# Module 01
Reserve the first level headings (#) for the start of a new Module. This will help to organize your portfolio in an intuitive fashion.  
**Note: Please edit this template to your heart's content. This is meant to be the armature upon which you build your individual portfolio. You do not need to keep this instructive text in your final portfolio, although you do need to keep module and assignment names so we can identify what is what.**


## Module 01 portfolio check
The first of your second level headers (##) is to be used for the portfolio content checks. The Module 01 portfolio check has been built for you directly into this template, but will also be available as a stand-alone markdown document available on the MICB425 GitHub so that you know what is required in each module section in your portfolio. The completion status and comments will be filled in by the instructors during portfolio checks when your current portfolios are pulled from GitHub.

## Data science Friday  
The remaining second level headers (##) are for separating data science Friday, regular course, and project content. In this module, you will only need to include data science Friday and regular course content; projects will come later in the course.

### Installation check
Third level headers (###) should be used for links to assignments, evidence worksheets, problem sets, and readings, as seen here.  

Use this space to include your installation screenshots.



### Portfolio repo setup
Detail the code you used to create, initialize, and push your portfolio repo to GitHub. This will be helpful as you will need to repeat many of these steps to update your porfolio throughout the course.



### RMarkdown pretty html challenge
Paste your code from the in-class activity of recreating the example html.



## Origins and Earth Systems
### Evidence worksheet 01 
The template for the first Evidence Worksheet has been included here. The first thing for any assignment should link(s) to any relevant literature (which should be included as full citations in a module references section below).

You can copy-paste in the answers you recorded when working through the evidence worksheet into this portfolio template. 

As you include Evidence worksheets and Problem sets in the future, ensure that you delineate Questions/Learning Objectives/etc. by using headers that are 4th level and greater. This will still create header markings when you render (knit) the document, but will exclude these levels from the Table of Contents. That's a good thing. You don't' want to clutter the Table of Contents too much.

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?  
What is the number of prokaryotes on Earth and in different resevoirs? What are these resevoirs?

What is the total nutrient content present in prokaryotes and how much carbon do these prokaryotes produce?

* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  
In aquatic environment, they looked at average cellular density and multiplied it with the estimated amount of marine and fresh water quantities

In soil, they also looked at cellular density measured from direct counts from forest soil and past field studies. These values, along with previously estimated amounts of soil on Earth, were used to calculate soil prokaryotic numbers.

For terrestrial subsurfaces, they estimated prokaryotic numbers from ground water based on values of several sites, and multiplied this using the estimated value of ground water on Earth. 

They also looked at the average porosity of Earth's soil, and used known values of space occupied by prokaryotes in these pores.

To measure carbon content and production in prokaryotes: They took cell number in soil and calculated its dry weight. They then assumed the amount of carbon in prokaryotes is equal to half their dry weight. They also assumed that the amount of carbon produced during each turnover is about four times their carbon content. Using this data, and information about prokaryotic turnover rates, they calculated the production of prokaryotic carbon.

* Summarize the main results or findings.  

The number of prokaryotes and total amount of cellular carbon on earth were estimated to be 4-6 * 10^ 30 cells, and 350-550 Pg of C
Total amount of prokaryotic carbon is 60-100% of the estimated total carbon in plants
Earth's prokaryotes contain 85-130 Pg of N and 9-14 Pg of P

Number or Prokaryote Cells in...
Earth: 12*10^29
Ocean: 2.6*10^29
Soil: 2.5*10^30
Oceanic + Terrestrial subsurfaces:0.25-2.5 * 10^30 

Prokaryotic Turnover times:
200m upper ocean: 6-25 days
Ocean below 200m: 0.8 years
Soil 2.5 years
Subsurfaces is from 1-2 * 10^3 years

Cellular production rate ~ 1.7*10^30 cells/year, and highest in open oceans

* Do new questions arise from the results?  

How does the abundance of the prokaryotes in these environments play a role in the total metabolic potential of the ecosystem.
What are some possible consequences/predictions we can make about events in the future, that involve prokaryotes, with this given data.
What significance does this large number of prokaryotes play in on Earth?
What factors and events do they cause or influence on Earth?

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  

Supplemental Figures were not provided, they would have helped to make things easier to understand, and possibly easier to see the magnitude of their results

Enough detail was provided about the results, however we are more concerned about if the methods were valid in calculating their results. Many of the sources for certain statistics (like cell density in soil) may have not been reliable, as much of this info was obtained from other studies, their methods are not made clear in this paper. As well, this paper performed many estimates and extrapolations to obtain their results, thus their calculations and numbers could be improved.

### Problem set 01
#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  

Open ocean: 1.2 * 10^29 (prokaryotes mostly found in upper 200m of open ocean)

Soil: 2.5 * 10^29

Oceanic + Terrestrial subsurfaces: 3.8 *10^30

* What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  

Upper 200m ocean density: 5 X 10^5  cells/mL

Prochlorococcus:   density: 4*10^4 cells/mL

Upper 200m of the ocean contains a total 3.6 x 10^28 cells

Autotrophs = 2.9 x 10^27 cells

8% of autotrophs are responsible for the amount of carbon being cycled through the Earth's oceans, which ultimately supports carbon availability for the rest of the heterotrophs present (92%)

* What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?  

Autotroph:Carbon from inorganic sources: self-nourishing, fixes inorganic carbon into biomass

Heterotroph: Carbon from organic sources: assimilates organic carbon

Lithotroph: Obtain electrons from inorganic sources: assimilates & metabolizes inorganic substrates and releases energy

* Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  

Mariana's Trench contains life at 10.9km deep. A further 4km deeper contains life as well. The main limiting factor for life at this depth is temperature.

* Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?  

Highest altitude that contains life is 8.8km above sea level at Mt Everest. Although life may exist higher than this, it is extremely rare due to ionizing radiation and lack of nutrients and moisture.

* Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth’s biosphere measured in km?  

An accurate range may be from be top of Mt Everest (8.8km high) to the bottom of Mariana's Trench ( 10.9km deep), with an additional 4km deeper.Thus the vertical range of the biosphere is ~ 24km

* How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)  

(Population) * (turnovers / year) =       cells/year

In marine heterotrophs:

2.6 x 10^28 cells x 365 days / 16 turnovers = 8.2*10^29 cells/year

* What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  

We assume carbon efficiency = 20% (which author's used)
Assuming 5-20 femtograms of C / prokaryotic cell

~20fg of Carbon in a prokaryotic cell = 20^-30 petagrams.

Number of cells = 3.6 x 10^-30 cells

3.6x10^28 cells x 20^-30petagrams/cell   = 0.72 petagrams of carbon in marine heterotrophs

4 x 0 .72 (Authors used x4 for some reason)
2.88 petagrams of C / year

51 petagrams C / year  x 85% consumed ~43 petagrams of C consumed per year 

(43 petagrams of carbon /year)  / (2.88 petagrams/year)    =   14.9 or one turnover every 24.5 days

* How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  

4 x 10^-7 mutations/ generation
We want 4 simultaneous mutations
4 x 10^-7 ^4 = 2.56 x 10^-26 mutations / generation

3.6 x 10^ 28 cells x 22.8 = 8.2 x 10^29 cells / year 

Note (365/16 days generation time  = 22.8 turnovers /year)

8.2 x 10^29 cells / year  * mutation rate (2.56 x 10^-26 mutations/generation = 2.1 x 10^4 mutations / year

Paper says a result 0.4  hours / mutation

* Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  

* What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?

#R Markdown PDF Challenge


The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we’ve shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won’t feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We’re here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.

##Challenge Goals


The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It’s a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)

**hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](http://phdcomics.com) to see if you can find the image above**

*If you can’t find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown*


###Here’s a header!


Let’s be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents).

####Another header, now with maths

Perhaps you’re already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you’re so confused that you’ve forgotton how to add. Never fear! A ~~calculator~~ R is here:

```{r} 
1231521+12341556280987
```


###Table Time

Or maybe, after you’ve added those numbers, you feel like it’s about time for a table!
I’m going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It’s not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.


```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library")
```

And now you’ve almost finished your first RMarkdown! Feeling excited? We are! In fact, we’re so excited that maybe we need a big finale eh? Here’s ours! Include a fun gif of your choice!
